# Project_Tkinter

## Overview
Project_Tkinter is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python's Tkinter library. This application implements various operational research algorithms, including transportation algorithms such as the North-West Corner, Least Cost, and Stepping Stone methods, as well as other algorithms like Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Bellman-Ford.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for selecting and executing different algorithms.
- Visualization of results, including graphs and matrices.
- Support for multiple transportation algorithms.
- Dynamic input handling for vertices, supply, and demand.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Welsh-Powell**
- **Dijkstra**
- **Kruskal**
- **Bellman-Ford**
- **Ford-Fulkerson**
- **North-West Corner**
- **Least Cost**
- **Stepping-Stone**
- **Potential Method**

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

You can install the required packages using pip:

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project_tkinter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project_tkinter
   ```

3. Install the required packages (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python project_tkinter.py
   ```

2. Select an algorithm from the main interface.
3. Enter the required inputs (e.g., number of vertices, supply, and demand).
4. Click "Execute" to run the algorithm and view the results.
